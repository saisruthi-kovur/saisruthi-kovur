Hi, my name is Sai Sruthi and I am a highly ambitious, self-motivated, and driven software engineer based in Sunnyvale, CA. I graduated from the [University of California, Riverside](https://www.ucr.edu/) in December 2023 with an MS in Computer Science and have worked in the field ever since. 

I have a wide range of hobbies and passions that keep me busy. From reading and traveling to sketching portraits, I always seek new experiences and love staying engaged and learning new things.

I believe in continuous growth and strive to embody that principle. I have a passion for technology and always desire to push the limits of what is possible. I am excited to see where my career takes me and I am always open to new opportunities.
